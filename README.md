Recommended
* vscode-styled-components
You might need to switch to the workspace version of Typescript for this to pay attention to local customisations (specifically not complaining about `label` attributes). You can do this by typing `Ctrl+Shift+P` in VSCode and typing in `TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version`, then selecting the Workspace Version.
* ESLint (already configured in .vscode/settings.json)

Optional (but still recommended)
* Code Spell Checker
* GitHub Copilot
